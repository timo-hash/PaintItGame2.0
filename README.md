# My CPSC 210 Term Project

## Game: Fill the Screen 


- **What will the application do?**

*A game that allows the players to maneuver a square around a blank screen. Every step the square moves will fill
its previous spot with another black box (i.e. the square leaves a trail behind).
The objective is to fill the entire screen with the black box. The square is restricted to move within the boundaries
and the square cannot cross the trail. If the stage is completed, the next stage will appear with more obstacles. If
the player fails, the game will be over and the player will be asked if they would like to try again or quit. Players 
who complete all stages will have their name recorded on the leaderboard along with the time taken to complete 
the stages.*

- **Who will use it?**

*Anyone who enjoys a challenge, solving puzzles or is simply just bored.*

- **Why is the project of interests to you?**

*Game development has always been an area of interest regarding computer programming. I would like to build a game for
others to play.*
